	   In a proxy configuration, you can setup ports that accept miners for work based on

	   are automatically switched a coin determined by the server.

	   The default coin is the first configured pool for each algorithm and coin switching 
	   can be triggered using the coinSwitch.js script in the scripts folder.

	   Please note miner address authentication must be disabled when using NOMP in a proxy
	   configuration and that payout processing is left up to the server administrator.
